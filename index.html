            <h2>Damario Escoffery</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer and a big sports fan. I watch most sports, but my favorite sports are football, basketball, volleyball, and cricket, to name a few. I played volleyball in high school for 4 years. I aspire to be a software engineer because I am fascinated with coding. I'm interested in web development because it's a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.</p>
