            <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer and a big sports fan. I watched most sports but my favorite sports are Football, Basketball, Volleyball and Cricket to name a few. I played volleyball in high school for 4 years. I aspire to be a software engineer because I was facinated with coding. I'm interested in Web Development because it stepping stone in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. </p>
